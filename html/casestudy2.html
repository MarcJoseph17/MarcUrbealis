            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <!-- Key takeaways content goes here -->
    
            <p>Throughout the project, several crucial takeaways emerged. First and foremost, users expressed a clear desire for simplicity when interacting with the SunRunner BRT system. The current setup involving multiple apps and payment options was deemed unnecessarily complex and time-consuming. A unified, user-friendly mobile app that simplifies the entire transit experience is highly sought after. Additionally, users highlighted the importance of comprehensive and real-time information about SunRunner services, including schedules, routes, and service updates. 

            <p>Providing accurate and up-to-date information within the app is paramount for building user trust and encouraging regular use. Lastly, streamlining fare payment options within the app was recognized as a priority, myself and our three users all felt that PSTA does not need to partnered up with Flamingo fares. In fact, after a quick analysis of flamingos service, we believe that PSTA would save money just using their own app to store and process payments for their customers! Users favored the convenience of reducing the number of choices in the overall user experience, simplicity always wins. </p>

        <section class="roadmap">
            <h2>Roadmap</h2>
            <!-- Roadmap content goes here -->
            <p>The project's roadmap comprised several crucial phases that guided its successful execution. It commenced with an extensive user research phase, encompassing surveys and data analysis, to comprehend user behaviors, preferences, and pain points concerning the SunRunner BRT system and similar transit apps. A comprehensive competitive analysis followed, yielding insights into successful features in other transit apps. 

            <p>Next, the project focused on addressing three primary pain points: complexity, information gaps, and options. These pain points became the project's core focus during the subsequent design and prototyping phase, where wireframes and prototypes were developed with a specific emphasis on simplicity, comprehensive information, and streamlined fare payment. Usability testing with real users informed design refinements before transitioning to the development phase. Throughout development, testing and feedback collection ensured continuous improvements. 
                
             <p>To Further improve on this project a revamp of the PSTA website would be beneficial in correlation with the new app and its features!
