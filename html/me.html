            <p>Upon graduating from Monmouth University with a bachelors degree in Business Administration & Management Decision Sciences, I worked with two notable companies from which I gained immense experience and industry insight, first being Greystar. At Greystar, I was responsible for identifying new opportunities for business growth, optimizing marketing strategies, and analyzing business processes and finances under the district manager. After leaving the real estate industry, I found a new opportunity in a role at Walser Wealth Management as their new Business Development Specialist in early 2021, landing my first role in a marketing-operational position that was key to business growth & development. Here I was able to help grow Walser’s client base and increase managed accounts and services. I was also responsible for sourcing new leads while maintaining relationships with existing clients. During this time, I explored old areas of interest in graphic design and basic coding, which led to a small project centered around “taxes”. The goal was to make a quick advertisement that would reach our clients in a sympathetic manner, in hopes that it would prompt them to take action and sit with us to make a tax-oriented plan with us to decrease their liabilities.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, what I had realized was it had been the first time since graduating college that I actually enjoyed what I was working on. Yes, you read that right. I realized I was in the wrong field developing the wrong skills; I realized I needed to use my brain's creative genius in another way outside of operational business management. After working through these urges to be creative and more technical, I found myself thinking of web design & development. Thankfully, I had learned and experienced a lot from my internship in NJ. I was able to oversee the project management conversations, UI/UX designs, implementation of design concept through HTML/CSS/JS, etc., all the way to the clients' reaction once completed. Remembering this internship and what it showed me is what made me leave business management and marketing to pursue a much more technical and rewarding career in Software Engineering / Web Design & Development. In this ever-evolving industry, I will be able to gain special skills and grow with them as I will with my portfolio. Two years later, I've finished my Front-End Web Design & Development Certification Program with the F.I.R.S.T Institute of Creative Learning, and am now in school for my second certification in Software Engineering at Champlain College. I am getting closer to my goal of being a full-stack developer! - For more information, please follow all my social media links to keep up with my journey and work!❤ (linktr.ee/marcurbealis)</p>

            <p>I began my early education at St. John Vianney High School where I was a two-sport varsity athlete in soccer and volleyball. I then continued my education at Monmouth University where I received my bachelor's degree in Business Administration & Management Decision Sciences. Upon graduation, I received an offer to intern at CMDS (https://www.cmdsonline.com), an Advertising Agency in Colts Neck, NJ. Here is where I received vast insight on key technical & operational skills while shadowing the majority of staff members. This intense internship is what led me to have a much bigger passion for the digital arts such as graphic design, illustration, and coding (web development).</p>
