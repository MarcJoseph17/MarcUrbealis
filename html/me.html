            <p>After graduating from Monmouth University in West Long Branch, NJ, with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration & Management Decision Sciences and a Minor in Marketing, I worked with two notable companies from which I gained immense experience and industry insight. The first was Greystar, where I was responsible for identifying new opportunities for business growth at the Avana location in Westchase, FL. I took part in optimizing marketing strategies and analyzing business processes and finances under the district manager. During this time, I found a new opportunity at Walser Wealth Management as their new Business Development Specialist in early 2021, landing my second role in a business development position that was key to business growth and operational management. Here, I was able to help grow Walser's client base and increase managed accounts and services. I was also responsible for sourcing new leads while maintaining relationships with existing clients.
              <br>
              <br>During this time, I explored old areas of interest in graphic design and web development, which led to a small project centered around "creating the best tax strategy." The goal was to create a quick advertisement that would reach our clients in a sympathetic manner, in hopes that it would prompt them to take action and work toward decreasing their liabilities. This small project helped me to realize I was in the wrong field, strengthening the wrong skills. I knew in my heart I needed to go back to old roots and become a creator and innovator, someone with more respect for the digital arts and its connection to human experience. Once deciding that I wanted to go back to working in the web design and development industry as I had during my internship, I knew I needed to further my education in that space. Fast forward two years later, I've finished my Front-End Web Design & Development Certification Program with the F.I.R.S.T Institute of Creative Learning and am now in school for my second certification in Software Engineering at Champlain College. I am getting closer to my goal of being a well-rounded Front-End designer and developer.</p>

            <h1 id="mystorytitle2">Fun facts…</h1>
            <p>I began my early education at St. John Vianney High School, where I was a two-sport varsity athlete in soccer and volleyball. During my senior year at Monmouth University, I received an offer to intern at CMDS, a notable marketing agency in Colts Neck, NJ. Here I honed my technical, operational, and management skills. I was fortunate enough to find an internship that granted me insight into each department (I specifically asked for this so I could really find where I would be most valuable). I shadowed team members and joined in on projects and meetings. This intense internship is what led me to have a greater passion for web design, development, and marketing strategies and is ultimately why I decided to leave business development in 2022.</p>
