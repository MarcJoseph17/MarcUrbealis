Additionally, the absence of a comprehensive local statistics system limits the ability to track individual and team performance, hindering the community's engagement in celebrating local sports achievements. This fragmentation within the local sports ecosystem calls for a solution that unifies team formation, provides easy access to local tryouts, and introduces a comprehensive stats feature to maximize connections and opportunities within the sports community.
