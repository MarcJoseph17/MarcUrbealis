            <img id="intro-pic" src="../images/use2phonescover.png" alt="">
            <p>An easy and user-friendly UI-UX design and research study <p>for the St.Petersburg PSTA SunRunner Bus Transit System.</p>

        <section class="overview">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <!-- Project overview content goes here -->
            <p>The SunRunner Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system has been introduced as a transformative transportation solution connecting Downtown St. Petersburg, Central Ave. business districts, Pasadena, and St. Pete Beach. The SunRunner not only improves local transportation but also offers a wide range of community, economic, and environmental benefits. However, there are significant user experience challenges, especially concerning information access, fare payment, and convenience. Currently, users must rely on multiple apps for different functions, including "Transit" for schedule information and "Flamingo Fares" for ticket purchase. This case study will analyze why the development of a dedicated SunRunner app, a "one-stop shop," is crucial for addressing these challenges and enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="problem-statement">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <!-- Pain points content goes here -->
            <p>The absence of a dedicated mobile app for the SunRunner Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system has led to fragmented user experiences. Users are currently required to rely on multiple applications for tasks like checking schedules and purchasing tickets, resulting in inconvenience and reduced adoption of the fare system. This fragmented approach also hinders easy access to critical information about routes, accessibility, and real-time tracking. To address these issues and improve the overall user experience, a comprehensive SunRunner app that serves as a one-stop solution is urgently needed.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="goals">
            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <!-- Project goals content goes here -->
            <p>The primary objective is to provide a unified and seamless user experience through the development of a dedicated SunRunner app. This app aims to simplify interactions with the BRT system, offering route planning, real-time tracking, fare payment, and accessibility information all within a single platform. Additionally, it seeks to streamline the fare payment process, making ticket purchases more user-friendly. Ensuring access to real-time information, promoting inclusivity with robust accessibility features, supporting local businesses along the route, and contributing to environmental and economic sustainability are also key goals.</p>

            <!-- Design process content goes here -->
            <img src="../images/1*33khN9zpFCMWnF8pLqeVTQ.png" alt="">
            <p>The design process for the SunRunner app will be rooted in user-centered principles. It will commence with thorough user research to grasp the needs, preferences, and pain points of existing and potential users, informing the app's structure and feature prioritization. Subsequently, wireframes and mockups will be crafted to create an intuitive user interface with a focus on usability and accessibility. Usability testing and iterative design will play pivotal roles, allowing for continuous refinement based on user feedback. Integration with existing systems, such as the Flamingo Fares payment system, will be executed seamlessly to maintain a coherent user experience. Ultimately, the outcome will be a user-friendly SunRunner app that unifies the experience, streamlines fare payment, provides real-time information, ensures accessibility, and supports local businesses, all while contributing to the goals of the BRT system.</p>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <!-- Key takeaways content goes here -->
    
            <p>Throughout the project, several crucial takeaways emerged. First and foremost, users expressed a clear desire for simplicity when interacting with the SunRunner BRT system. The current setup involving multiple apps and payment options was deemed unnecessarily complex and time-consuming. A unified, user-friendly mobile app that simplifies the entire transit experience is highly sought after. Additionally, users highlighted the importance of comprehensive and real-time information about SunRunner services, including schedules, routes, and service updates. 

            <p>Providing accurate and up-to-date information within the app is paramount for building user trust and encouraging regular use. Lastly, streamlining fare payment options within the app was recognized as a priority, myself and our three users all felt that PSTA does not need to partnered up with Flamingo fares. In fact, after a quick analysis of flamingos service, we believe that PSTA would save money just using their own app to store and process payments for their customers! Users favored the convenience of reducing the number of choices in the overall user experience, simplicity always wins. </p>

        <section class="roadmap">
            <h2>Roadmap</h2>
            <!-- Roadmap content goes here -->
            <p>The project's roadmap comprised several crucial phases that guided its successful execution. It commenced with an extensive user research phase, encompassing surveys and data analysis, to comprehend user behaviors, preferences, and pain points concerning the SunRunner BRT system and similar transit apps. A comprehensive competitive analysis followed, yielding insights into successful features in other transit apps. 

            <p>Next, the project focused on addressing three primary pain points: complexity, information gaps, and options. These pain points became the project's core focus during the subsequent design and prototyping phase, where wireframes and prototypes were developed with a specific emphasis on simplicity, comprehensive information, and streamlined fare payment. Usability testing with real users informed design refinements before transitioning to the development phase. Throughout development, testing and feedback collection ensured continuous improvements. 
                
             <p>To Further improve on this project a revamp of the PSTA website would be beneficial in correlation with the new app and its features!
